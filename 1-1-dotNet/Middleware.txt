It is software that is injected into the application pipeline to handle requests and responses. 

They are just like chained to each other and form as a pipeline. 

The incoming requests are passed through this pipeline where all middleware is configured, 
and middleware can perform some action on the request before passing it to the next middleware. 
Same as for the responses, they are also passing through the middleware but in reverse order.




Middleware Has access to both Request and Response
Middleware May simply pass the Request to next Middleware
Middleware May process and then pass the Request to next Middleware
Middleware May handle the Request and short-circuit the pipeline
Middleware May process the outgoing Response
Middlewares are executed in the order they are added

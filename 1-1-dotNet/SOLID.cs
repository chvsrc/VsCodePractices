software entities :: classes, modules, functions, etc.

S: Single Responsi-bility principle: 
Every class should have only one responsibility.

software entities(classes) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

L: Lis-ko-v sub-sti-tution principle: 
Functions that use references to base classes 
must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.

Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

D: Dependency inversion principle:
Depend upon abstractions, [not] con-cre-tions.

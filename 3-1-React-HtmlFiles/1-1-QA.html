1. What is React? <br/> 
React is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications (SPAs). It focuses on creating reusable UI components that manage their own state, enabling efficient and declarative rendering of the UI.
React uses a virtual DOM ‚Äî an in-memory representation of the actual DOM. When state or props change, React updates the virtual DOM first, compares it to the previous version (diffing), and then applies only the necessary changes to the real DOM, improving performance.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2. What are components in React? <br/> 
Components are the building blocks of a React application. They encapsulate UI elements and logic, making the UI modular and reusable.
There are two main types:
Functional Components:
These are JavaScript functions that accept props and return JSX. Since React 16.8, functional components can use hooks for managing state and lifecycle events. Example:
Class Components:
These are ES6 classes extending React.Component. They have a render() method that returns JSX and can maintain internal state and lifecycle methods.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3. What is JSX? <br/> 
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML and is used in React to describe what the UI should look like.
JSX makes it easier to write and visualize UI components with embedded JavaScript expressions inside {}.
// const element = h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
to
// const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, world!');
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4. What are props in React? <br/> 
Props/properties are inputs to components. They are passed from parent components to child components as attributes and are read-only inside the receiving component.
Props enable data flow from parent to child and are fundamental to React‚Äôs component communication.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
5. What is state in React? <br/> 
State is a built-in React object used to hold data that can change over the component‚Äôs lifecycle. Unlike props, state is managed internally within the component and can be updated with setState in class components or via hooks in functional components.
When state changes, React triggers a re-render to update the UI with the new data.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
6. Difference between state and props? <br/> 
Aspect.                              Props                                State
Who manages it? <br/>                       Parent component (read-only)         Component itself (read/write)
Purpose                              Pass data & callbacks                Store internal data
Mutability                           Immutable inside the component       Mutable via setState/hooks
Lifecycle                            Passed during render                 Maintained within component
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
7. What is the virtual DOM? <br/> 
The virtual DOM is an abstraction of the actual DOM, represented as a lightweight JavaScript object tree.
When component state or props change, React:
* Creates a new virtual DOM tree.
* Compares it (diffing) with the previous virtual DOM tree.
* Determines the minimal set of real DOM updates.
* Applies those changes efficiently.
This reduces expensive direct DOM manipulation and improves performance.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
8. What is the purpose of keys in React lists? <br/> 
Keys help React uniquely identify elements in a list so it can detect which items changed, were added, or removed.
Keys should be unique and stable (ideally unique IDs). Without keys, React may inefficiently re-render or reorder elements incorrectly.
Example:
const listItems = todos.map(todo =>
  <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</li>
);
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
9. Explain the React component lifecycle (class components).
React class components go through phases:
Mounting: When the component is created and inserted into the DOM.
constructor()
static getDerivedStateFromProps()
render()
componentDidMount() ‚Äî ideal for fetching data or subscriptions.
Updating: When props or state changes.
static getDerivedStateFromProps()
shouldComponentUpdate() ‚Äî optimize rendering by returning false if no update needed.
render()
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() ‚Äî capture info before DOM updates.
componentDidUpdate() ‚Äî perform side effects post-update.
Unmounting: Component is removed from the DOM.
componentWillUnmount() ‚Äî cleanup (cancel timers, remove listeners).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
10. What are React hooks? <br/>
Hooks are functions introduced in React 16.8 that let you ‚Äúhook into‚Äù React state and lifecycle from functional components.
Common hooks:
useState: Adds state to functional components.
useEffect: Manages side effects like fetching, subscriptions.
useContext: Consumes React context.
useReducer: For complex state management.
useMemo, useCallback: Memoize values or functions for performance.
Hooks let you write cleaner, reusable components without needing classes.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
11. What is useEffect hook and when is it used? <br/>
useEffect runs side effects after rendering:
useEffect(() => {
  // Side effect: fetch data, subscribe, manipulate DOM, etc.
  return () => {
    // Cleanup before next effect or unmount
  };
}, [dependencies]);
Runs after every render by default.
Can optimize by specifying dependency array [] to run only once (on mount).
Or include variables to run effect only when they change.
Example:
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
}, [userId]);  // Runs when userId changes
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
12. Explain controlled vs uncontrolled components.
Controlled Components: Form elements where React state drives the input value. The component fully controls input behavior.
const [value, setValue] = React.useState('');
return <input value={value} onChange={e => setValue(e.target.value)} />;
Uncontrolled Components: Form elements where the DOM maintains their own state. Accessed via refs.
const inputRef = React.useRef();
<input ref={inputRef} />;
Controlled components are preferred for validation and dynamic form behavior.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
13. What is context API? <br/>
Context API allows passing data through the component tree without passing props down manually at every level.
Use cases: themes, user auth, locale.
const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');
function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
      <Toolbar />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}
function Toolbar() {
  return <ThemedButton />;
}
function ThemedButton() {
  const theme = React.useContext(ThemeContext);
  return <button className={theme}>Click me</button>;
}
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
14. What is Redux? <br/> How does it relate to React? <br/>
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, often used with React for managing global state.
Stores application state in a single immutable state tree.
State is updated by dispatching actions.
Reducers specify how the state changes based on actions.
Redux helps when many components need to access or update the same state, avoiding prop drilling.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
15. How does React‚Äôs reconciliation algorithm work? <br/>
React uses a diffing algorithm to compare old and new virtual DOM trees. It assumes:
Elements of different types produce different trees.
Keys help identify which children changed.
It calculates the minimum number of changes to update the real DOM efficiently.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
16. What are Higher Order Components (HOCs)? <br/>
HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new enhanced component.
Example:
function withLogger(WrappedComponent) {
  return function(props) {
    console.log('Rendering', WrappedComponent.name);
    return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
  }
}
They help reuse logic (e.g., authorization, data fetching).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
17. Difference between React.memo and useMemo
React.memo is a HOC that memoizes a functional component, preventing re-render if props haven‚Äôt changed.
useMemo memoizes the result of a function inside a component to avoid expensive calculations on every render.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
18. What are React portals? <br/>
Portals let you render children into a DOM node outside the parent component‚Äôs DOM hierarchy.
Useful for modals, tooltips.
ReactDOM.createPortal(children, document.getElementById('modal-root'))
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
19. How do you optimize React app performance? <br/>
Use React.memo and PureComponent.
Code splitting and lazy loading.
Avoid inline functions/objects where possible.
Use virtualization for large lists (e.g., react-window).
Memoize expensive computations (useMemo).
Avoid unnecessary renders (shouldComponentUpdate or React.memo).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
20. Explain Suspense and React.lazy
React.lazy enables code-splitting components dynamically:
const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./OtherComponent'));
Use Suspense to show a fallback UI while loading:
<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
  <OtherComponent />
</Suspense>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
21. How do you handle error boundaries in React? <br/>
Error boundaries catch JS errors in child components during rendering, lifecycle, and constructors.
You create a class component with:
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }
  
  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    return { hasError: true };
  }
  
  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    // Log error
  }
  
  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }
    return this.props.children;
  }
}

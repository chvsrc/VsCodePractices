// Finalizers === Destructor // ~
Finalizers in C# are methods inside the class used to destroy instances of that class when they are no longer needed. 
The Finalizer is called implicitly by the .NET Frameworkâ€™s Garbage collector and therefore programmer has no control as when to invoke the Finalizer. 
An instance variable or an object is eligible for destruction when it is no longer reachable.
